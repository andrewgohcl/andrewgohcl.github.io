# Project Title: Create a model that can predict when mosquitos carrying the WNV will appear?

West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the continental United States. It is most commonly spread to people by the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes can also transmit the WNV to birds and vice versa. Birds can also get the WNV by eating other infected birds.

Cases of WNV occur most duing summer and continue through fall. Unfortunately, There are no vaccines to prevent or medications to treat WNV in people.

In response to large outbreaks of WNV, pesticides will be sprayed to control the mosquito population, However, spraying pesticides in response to WNV outbreaks would mean that the mosquitos might have already spread the WNV before being eliminated.

Our aim is to create a model that can predict when mosquitos carrying the WNV will appear, which will allow us to premptively spray pesticide to control the mosquito population.

## Datasets

1. Kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus)

## Problems with the dataset

+ Missing values caused by null. - filled with various methods.
+ Trace values filled with other values for weather stations.
+ Some data not collected by 1 of the weather station.
+ Different information disclosed in train/test.
    - ie. Num of Mosquitoes in Test not disclosed.
