An investment professional with close to a decade of experience in public markets. Experienced in setting up of family office, porfolio management, financial modelling and equities research (traditional and machine learning techniques).

What am i about: I'm building tools to augment traditional ways of equity research with news ways of data wrangling (alternative data, unstructured data), machine learning, deep learning and NLP. Also, using Pandas for exploratory data analysis and data visualizations makes life easier compared to Excel.

Happy to connect via my linkedin.
